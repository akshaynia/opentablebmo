1. I have spent total of 10 hours with a lots of research. If I had more time then I have tried to show the data
   in the cards form rather than showing it in the tabular format. 

2.The latest feature is the "react hooks" which nowadays are very popular. But I haven't used them till now.

3.I haven't tracked down the performance till now, still if we need to increase the performance then we can
 have look at the images and can compress them to get better performance. Also, we can use "Lazy loading" also
 to boost the performance.

4.I would have rather give good structered fields to filter the api.

5. I, me and myself----
